== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a third-party email service? =

No! CN Blog Mailer uses WordPress's built-in wp_mail() function. However, for better deliverability with large lists, we recommend using an SMTP plugin like WP Mail SMTP.

You can configure the sending frequency in settings. Options include daily, twice weekly, weekly, or manual sending only.

= Can I customize the email template? =

Yes! The free version includes basic template customization (colors, fonts). The Pro version offers advanced custom templates.

= Is there a subscriber limit? =

The free version has no hard limit, but performance may vary based on your server. For lists over 500 subscribers, we recommend the Pro version with email queue management.

= Can I import existing subscribers? =

CSV import is available in the Pro version. In the free version, you can add subscribers manually or via the subscription form.

= How do subscribers unsubscribe? =

Every email includes an automatic unsubscribe link. Subscribers can opt-out with one click.

= Is it GDPR compliant? =

Yes! The plugin includes:
* Clear consent during subscription
* Easy unsubscribe process
* Complete data deletion on uninstall (if configured)
* No data sent to third parties

== Privacy Policy ==

CN Blog Mailer stores subscriber information (email addresses, names, subscription dates) in your WordPress database. No data is sent to external services unless you configure an SMTP service.

When subscribers use the unsubscribe link, they can opt to delete all their data.

If you delete the plugin and choose to remove data, all subscriber information will be permanently deleted from your database.
